# Sentiment Analysis Web Application

This repository contains the HTML files for a simple web application that performs sentiment analysis on user-provided text. The application includes two main pages: the input form (`index.html`) and the result display (`result.html`).

## File Descriptions

### `index.html`

The `index.html` file contains the form where users can input their text for sentiment analysis.

# `result.html`

The `result.html` file is used to display the result of the sentiment analysis. It shows the input text provided by the user and the predicted sentiment. Additionally, it provides a button to navigate back to the input form.
